# Hello

I am launching my new [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) blog today and deploying it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This will be a fun project and I've wanted to play around with Gatsby for a while and this will be the perfect opportunity to do that. Longer term I'll see if I actually use it to blog or not.
